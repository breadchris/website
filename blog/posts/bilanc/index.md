> I'm a big fan of Scratch. Up and running in a 30 min call!

[Bilanc](https://www.bilanc.co/) helps companies measure and improve the profitability of their customers. 
They bring finance and customer data together, assigning costs to every customer action. These granular insights can be used to optimize customer acquisition, costs and pricing, ultimately improving profitability.

The challenge they faced was how to take all of these data points - from financial transactions to usage
measurements to costs - and house them in one place for analysis.

The solution was Scratch Data. On a 30-minute Zoom call, they were able to integrate multiple 
data sources into their warehouse and start writing realtime customer-facing dashboards.
