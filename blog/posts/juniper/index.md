- [Christophe Rimann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherimann/), Co-Founder at Juniper 

[Juniper](https://www.juniperplatform.com/) builds software for behavioral health clinicians to improve quality of care. 
One of the tools they have to do this is health transparency data to identify ways to help clinicians.

With Scratch Data, Juniper has been able to marry public health datasets with their CRM in order to
surface these insights. And the integration took minutes: rather allocating an engineering sprint
to setting up their analytics database, they were able to integrate with a REST API.
