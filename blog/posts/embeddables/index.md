### Background:

[Embeddables](https://www.embeddables.com/) is a leading company specializing in building customer-facing experiences: from sign-up onboarding flows to personalization quizzes. They are entrenched in user analytics, handling 1.5 TB of data and 1 billion rows of information. Until recently, they were analyzing everything in Postgres.

### Challenges:

1. **Slow Query Response:** Embeddables' database was suffering from slow query responses, impacting real-time data analysis and hindering the delivery of timely and efficient solutions to its customers.
2. **High Volume Data Handling:** Managing such a large amount of data presented devops challenges - time taken away from building their product.
3. **Innovative Feature Launch:** Their existing database setup restricted Embeddables' capability to roll out new and innovative features.

### Solution:

To overcome these challenges, Embeddables adopted ScratchDB as a blazing-fast, efficient, and cost-effective way to run Clickhouse.

1. **Swift and Seamless Integration:** Embeddables experienced zero downtime during the integration of ScratchDB - we did it over a slice of pizza in Brooklyn.
2. **Exceptional Speed Improvement:** Post-integration, Embeddables witnessed a massive improvement in query speed compared to their previous Postgres setup.
3. **Economically Efficient:** ScratchDB provided a value-driven, cost-effective solution enabling optimal resource allocation.
4. **Innovation Unleashed:** The capabilities afforded by ScratchDB empowered Embeddables to develop and launch features that were previously unfeasible.

### Conclusion:

Embeddables’ transition to ScratchDB’s hosted Clickhouse has been pivotal, completely unblocking their ability to deliver a snappy, working app for their customers. The immediate improvements have removed the need for sysadmin work and allowed the team to focus on customer-facing features. Scratch Data, with its unparalleled speed, cost-effectiveness, and seamless integration, stands out as an invaluable asset for companies like Embeddables looking to navigate the challenges posed by extensive data and analytics needs.
